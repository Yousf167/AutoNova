            <p>Ferrari is an Italian luxury sports car manufacturer based in Maranello, Italy. Founded in 1939 by Enzo Ferrari (1898–1988), the company built its first car in 1940, adopted its current name in 1945, and began to produce its current line of road cars in 1947. Ferrari became a public company in 1960, and from 1963 to 2014 it was a subsidiary of Fiat S.p.A. It was spun off from Fiat's successor entity, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, in 2016. In 2024, the Wall Street Journal summed up the company's reputation in this way: "Ferrari has been synonymous with opulence, meticulous craftsmanship and ridiculously fast cars for nearly a century.</p>
            <p>In 1960, Ferrari was reorganized as a public company. It soon began searching for a business partner to handle its manufacturing operations: it first approached Ford in 1963, though negotiations fell through; later talks with Fiat, who bought 50% of Ferrari's shares in 1969, were more successful. In the second half of the decade, Ferrari also produced two cars that upended its more traditional models: the 1967 Dino 206 GT, which was its first mass-produced mid-engined road car,and the 1968 365 GTB/4, which possessed streamlined styling that modernised Ferrari's design language. The Dino in particular was a decisive movement away from the company's conservative engineering approach, where every road-going Ferrari featured a V12 engine placed in the front of the car, and it presaged Ferrari's full embrace of mid-engine architecture, as well as V6 and V8 engines, in the 1970s and 1980s.</p>
            <h3>Grand Prix and Formula One racing</h3>
            <p>The earliest Ferrari entity, Scuderia Ferrari, was created in 1929 — ten years before the founding of Ferrari proper — as a Grand Prix racing team. It was affiliated with automaker Alfa Romeo, for whom Enzo had worked in the 1920s. Alfa Romeo supplied racing cars to Ferrari, which the team then tuned and adjusted to their desired specifications. Scuderia Ferrari was highly successful in the 1930s: between 1929 and 1937 the team fielded such top drivers as Antonio Ascari, Giuseppe Campari, and Tazio Nuvolari, and won 144 out of its 225 races.</p>

            <p>The Purosangue probably pushes things the furthest, as befits its role as the first Ferrari four-door. This is a car with an almost avant garde cabin architecture upfront. Two binnacles sweep across the cabin, one for the driver, the other for the passenger, with air vents and full information displays on either side. Ferrari is aiming to deliver outstanding emotional engagement for all four passengers.  </p>
            <p>The two ‘wings’ converge in the middle with a topographical flourish. Beneath that meeting point is a new-for-the-Purosangue feature, which introduces a physical touchpoint in a set-up that relies mostly on digitalisation and haptics. This is a cylindrical control panel that rises smoothly out of the dashboard when it’s tapped, and gives the driver or passenger access to climate control, seat heating or seat massage functionality.</p>
