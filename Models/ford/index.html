                <h3>Ford Mustang</h3>
                <p>The Ford Mustang combines performance and style to deliver an unforgettable driving experience.The Ford Mustang is officially unveiled by Henry FordII at the World’s Fair in Flushing Meadows, New York, on April 17, 1964. That same day, the new car also debuted in Ford showrooms across America and almost 22,000 Mustangs were immediately snapped up by buyers. Named for a World War II fighter plane, the Mustang was one of the first vehicles that came to be known as a “pony car.” Ford sold more than 400,000 Mustangs within its first year of production, far exceeding sales expectations.The Mustang was conceived as a “working man’s Thunderbird,” according to Ford. The first models featured a long hood and short rear deck and carried a starting price tag of around $2,300. Ford general manager Lee Iacocca, who became president of the company in October 1964 (and later headed up Chrysler, which he was credited with reviving in the 1980s) was involved in the Mustang’s development and marketing. The car’s launch generated great interest. It was featured on the covers of Newsweek and Time magazines and the night before it went on sale, the Mustang was featured in commercials that ran simultaneously on all three major television networks. One buyer in Texas reportedly slept at a Ford showroom until his check cleared and he could drive his new Mustang home. The same year it debuted, the Mustang appeared on the silver screen in the James Bond movie “Goldfinger.” A green 1968 Mustang 390 GT was famously featured in the 1968 Steve McQueen movie “Bullitt,” in a car chase through the streets of San Francisco. Since then, Mustangs have appeared in hundreds of movies.

                    Within three years of its debut, some 500 Mustang fan clubs had cropped up. In March 1966, the 1 millionth Mustang rolled off the assembly line. In honor of the Mustang’s 35th anniversary in 1999, the U.S. Postal Service issued a stamp commemorating the original model. In 2004, Ford built its 300 millionth car, a 2004 Mustang GT convertible 40th anniversary model. Over the decades, the Mustang underwent numerous evolutions, and it remains in production today.

                <h3>Ford F-150</h3>
                <p>The Ford F-150 is built tough and designed smart, making it the ultimate pickup truck for work and play.The first Ford truck ever produced was called<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">the Ford Model TT, which was released in 1917. This laid the tracks for the first F-150s to come onto the scene.The Model TT was sold with only a chassis, and a factory body wasn't called the Ford Model TT, which was released in 1917. This laid the tracks for the first F-150s to come onto the scene.The Model TT was sold with only a chassis, and a factory body wasn't available until 1923. As its name suggests, the Model TT was a modified Model T, the first production vehicle to roll out of factories.

                    Ford's truck offerings grew into the Model A and Model B during the 1920s and early 1930s. In 1935, they began to produce the Model 50, which looks closer to our idea of what trucks are supposed to look like. This model was offered until 1941, when Ford stopped production to aid in World War II.
                    
                    First and Second F-Series Generations: 1948-1956
                    In 1948, the Ford F-1 light-duty truck was made available to the public. This first generation lasted from 1948 to 1952. The F-1 was the half-ton entry in a lineup of trucks that ranged all the way up to the heavy-duty F-8, which was called the "Big Job." During this first generation, the Ford truck got a lot of upgrades, such as a foot-operated windshield wiper and iconic round headlights. The Ford company got a lot of work down in the downtime from their pre-war offerings to this new truck that would pave the way for all future trucks.
                    
                    The second generation of Ford trucks lasted from the 1953 to 1956 model years and was called the F-100. The F-2 and F-3 were brought together to create the F-250, while the F-4 full-ton truck was renamed the F-350. The Ford F-Series trucks use this naming convention to this day. The second generation was the first to offer an automatic transmission and the last to use the flathead V-8 engine that Ford put into its trucks since 1932.
                    
                    Third and Fourth F-Series Generations: 1957-1966
                    The third generation brought a more recognizable boxy shape to the F-100. The F-100's overall style changed substantially in the 1957 model year: double the headlights, more metal in its grille and front fascia in general, flat sides with the option to remove the rear fenders, and more. It's in this generation that the modern truck bed begins to take shape. Factory-installed four-wheel-drive made its debut on the F-100 in 1959.
                    
                    The F-100 begin to offer engines that produced over 200 horsepower in the fourth generation. These two generations marked a large shift in marketing and design schemes, as Ford found its drivers were using their trucks for more recreational and commuting purposes than ever. The company began to add more luxury features such as carpeted floors and packages designed for camping in the F-100. 
                    
                    Fifth and Sixth F-Series Generations (1967-1979): Enters the F-150
                    The fifth generation heralded the Ford Ranger, which was originally an optional trim level for the F-Series. The still-present XLT trim level also showed up for the fifth generation in 1970. Ford trucks improved cabin comfort during the fifth generation, replacing many of the formerly hard interior surfaces with padded materials.
                    
                    In 1975, the F-150 was finally released. The F-150 was made as a heavy-duty F-100 option that would eventually replace the F-100 entirely. We first had a chance to get a SuperCab F-Series truck in 1973, during the sixth generation. Drivers could choose a model that offers a jump seat that faced toward the center of the cab or a rear bench seat that faced forward. The sixth generation also introduced the Lariat trim level in 1978.
                    
                    Seventh and Eighth F-Series Generations: 1980-1991
                    The F-100 became history in 1984 when the F-150 became Ford's base-level light-duty model. This generation saw an increase in aerodynamics in the truck's design. The F-Series were made much lighter to improve efficiency in the seventh generation. The use of plastics, lighter steels, and aluminum became more commonplace in the manufacture of the F-Series. In 1983, the first diesel engine was made available, exclusively for the F-250.
                    
                    Arguably, the 1980 generational redesign paved the way for the F-Series' dominance over the American pickup world. From its modern style to its reliable strength, the F-100 and, eventually, the F-150 became the high-water mark for pickup truck excellence. Need proof? In 1977, the F-Series became the best-selling truck in America, and it has never relinquished that title. In 1981, it also became the best-selling vehicle overall in the United States, and it still is to this day. We have the seventh and eighth generations to thank for that.
                    
                    Ninth F-Series Generation and Beyond
                    Though much has changed from the ninth generation and on, the F-150 has maintained its place at the head of the American truck scene. The 1992 ninth generation gave us a simpler-looking truck. The 1995 F-Series took the title of the world's best-selling vehicle. The 10th-generation SuperCab introduced the industry-first standard third door. The 10th generation from 1997 to 2003 debuted the four-door SuperCrew cab and the first King Ranch. The F-150 grew more sporty until the 13th generation in 2015, when Ford returned to a more classic pickup style.
                    
                    The F-150 is still history in the making today. The 2021 model year marked the first entry into the 14th generation. In 2021, we got our first hybrid F-150 with a powerful V-6. The 2022 model year brings us the F-150 Lightning, which is the first all-electric Ford truck ever produced. From the off-roading Raptor to the 2021 Super Duty that can tow up to an amazing 37,000 pounds, there truly is a Ford truck for every driver.

                <h3>Ford Explorer</h3>
                <p>The Ford Explorer is packed with advanced features and spacious interiors, perfect for your next adventure.The Ford Explorer is a range of SUVs manufactured by Ford Motor Company since the 1991 model year. As the first four-door SUV produced by Ford, the Explorer was introduced as a replacement for the two-door Bronco II.[5] Within the current Ford SUV range in North America, the Explorer is slotted between the Ford Edge and Ford Expedition. As with the Ford Ranger, the Explorer derives its name from a trim package previously offered on the Ford F-Series pickup trucks.

                    The Explorer has been offered in multiple chassis and powertrain layouts. The first two generations were directly derived from the Ford Ranger, switching to a model-specific chassis for the third and fourth generations. The fifth generation was repackaged as a crossover SUV, adopting a variant of the Ford Taurus chassis architecture.[3]
                    
                    Alongside the five-door Explorer wagon, a three-door Explorer wagon was offered from 1991 to 2003, officially referred to as the Explorer Sport after 1999, serving as the direct replacement of the Bronco II; the 2001–2010 Ford Explorer Sport Trac was a crew-cab pickup derived from the model line. For police use, the Ford Police Interceptor Utility has been derived from the fifth and sixth-generation Explorer to replace the Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor (and the later Taurus-based Police Interceptor Sedan). Through rebranding, Mazda, Mercury, and Lincoln have sold versions of the Explorer; Lincoln currently markets the sixth-generation model line as the Lincoln Aviator.
                    
                    For the North American market, the first four generations of the Explorer were produced by Ford at its Louisville Assembly Plant (Louisville, Kentucky) and at its now-closed St. Louis Assembly Plant (Hazelwood, Missouri); the model line is currently produced at Chicago Assembly Plant (Chicago, Illinois).
                    
                    In 2020, CNBC reported the Ford Explorer range as the best-selling SUV of all time in America.</p>
